# Small Office Network Simulation – Cisco Packet Tracer

This project simulates a small office Local Area Network (LAN) using Cisco Packet Tracer. It demonstrates basic networking concepts including IP addressing, static routing, and server-client communication.

## 🔧 Project Overview

- **Topology**: 2 Routers, 4 Switches, 6 PCs
- **Tools Used**: Cisco Packet Tracer
- **Configuration**:
  - Manual IP Addressing (IPv4)
  - Static Routing between routers
  - Basic server access and communication tests (ping, file transfer)
